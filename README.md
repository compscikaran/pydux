# PyDux

Redux like unidirectional state management implementation for Python.

## How the idea came about

The idea came about when I had finished Facebook's Talk on Flux Architecture and seen few of Dan Abramov's interviews, and I thought to myself why this kind of pattern does not exist in python.
So I set out to implement the same in the language I use everyday.

## What is PyDux

Key Features -
1. Simple Redux like Unidirectional application store
2. Supports all the familiar patterns such as reducers, subscribers, actions, action creators, middlewares
3. Time travel debugging which allows to go to any previous or forward state in the store's history
